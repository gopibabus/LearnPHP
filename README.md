## Why PHP?

Basically, anything that you want to do on a web server, you can do with PHP. Make a blog? Yep. Create a full fledged software-as-a-serivce application? Absolutely. Write a little script to process some data in a few seconds? PHP is great for that. Write a complicated set of scripts that accidentally becomes a successful software business? PHP is used like that a lot.

The PHP website lists the following uses:

- Server-side scripting
- Command-line scripting
- Writing desktop applications
