# ðŸ”¥Language Constructs

?> **Language constructs** are not functions, and so cannot be used as a callback function. They follow rules that are different from functions when it comes to parameters and the use of parentheses. For example, echo doesnâ€™t always need parentheses when you call it and, if you call it with more than one argument, then you should use parentheses.

| Language Construct | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| assert             | Debug command to test a condition and do something if it is not true.      |
| echo/print         | Output value                                                               |
| exit/die           | Terminate the program.                                                     |
| return             | Terminates a function and returns control & value to the calling scope.    |
| eval               | Evaluates a string as PHP code.                                            |
| empty              | Returns a Boolean value depending on whether the variable is empty or not. |
| isset              | Returns true if the variable has been set and false otherwise.             |
| unset              | Clears a variable.                                                         |
| constant           | Used to retrieve the value of a constant.                                  |
| list               | Assigns multiple variables at one time from an array.                      |
| compact            | Creates an array from variables and their values.                          |

?> The **echo** construct does not return a value, not even null, and so is not suitable for use inside an expression. The **print** construct will however return a value
